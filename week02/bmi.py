heightinmetres= float(strheight)/100                             # converts input string height to float and calculates height in metres

bmi = round( weight/(heightinmetres ** 2 ),2)                    # performs bmi calculation and rounds to 2 decimal places
print ('Your BMI is: {}. ' .format (bmi) )                       # outputs calculation to screen
