Lab 2.3 Variables and state: referenced https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp
Lab 2.3.3 https://stackoverflow.com/questions/306400/how-to-randomly-select-an-item-from-a-list

Just realised that I have jumped ahead so now looking at indexing a list  in https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_lists.htm
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6127524/python-how-to-know-the-index-when-you-randomly-select-an-element-from-a-sequenc

Lab 2.3.5 and Lab3.3.3 are the same. I have put the answer into both week02 and week03



Lab 2.3.8: Eggs is a valid variable name because it does not begin with a number.
           100 is invalid because it begins with a number

         
Lab 2.3.9: referenced https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html
 Use int()   to return an intetger object constructed from a number or string x or return 0if no arguments are given
 Use float() to return a floating point number from a number or string x
 Use str()   to return a string version of object 

 Lab 3.2.1 : Observation : Rounding- although there is a warning in the lab that round rounds to the nearest even number there is also the issue of whether you are above or  below .5. E.g 6.5 rounds to 6 (nearest even number), but 6.6 rounds to 7 (odd number) . 


 Lab3.3 1: referenced https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings.asp
 Strings- the answer code does not include the word 'characters' but the question requires it.  
 Lab3.3.1: referehced  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4488570/how-do-i-write-a-tab-in-python
 and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11497376/how-do-i-specify-new-lines-on-python-when-writing-on-files#
 Learning point also here in respect of putting in two tabs to line up the output correctly in the printed answer.

 I have created two Visual Studio Code files to mess around with strings and test string methods in week03 folder

Lab 4.0 referenced https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21837208/check-if-a-number-is-odd-or-even-in-python/21837247
 The % sign is like division only it checks for the remainder, so if the number divided by 2 has a remainder of 0 it's even otherwise odd.







 Research re Booleans: referenced https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_booleans.asp
 In programming you often need to know if an expression is True or False.You can evaluate any expression in Python, and get one of two answers, True or False.
 When you compare two values, the expression is evaluated and Python returns the Boolean answer:
 When you run a condition in an if statement, Python returns True or False:

Most Values are True: Almost any value is evaluated to True if it has some sort of content.
Any string is True, except empty strings.
Any number is True, except 0.
Any list, tuple, set, and dictionary are True, except empty ones.

There are not many values that evaluate to False, except empty values, such as (), [], {}, "", the number 0, and the value None. And of course the value False evaluates to False.
