Lab 2.3.5 and Lab3.3.3 are the same. I have put the answer into both week02 and week03



Lab 2.3.8: Eggs is a valid variable name because it does not begin with a number.
           100 is invalid because it begins with a number

         
Lab 2.3.9: referenced https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html

 Lab 3.2.1 : Observation : Rounding- although there is a warning in the lab that round rounds to the nearest even number there is also the issue of whether you are above or  below .5. E.g 6.5 rounds to 6 (nearest even number), but 6.6 rounds to 7 (odd number) . 


 Lab3.3 1: referenced https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings.asp
 Strings- the answer code does not include the word 'characters' but the question requires it.  
 Lab3.3.1: referehced  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4488570/how-do-i-write-a-tab-in-python
 and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11497376/how-do-i-specify-new-lines-on-python-when-writing-on-files#

Lab 4.0 referenced https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21837208/check-if-a-number-is-odd-or-even-in-python/21837247
 The % sign is like division only it checks for the remainder, so if the number divided by 2 has a remainder of 0 it's even otherwise odd.
